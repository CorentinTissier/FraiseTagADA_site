Who does not want to have the secret of creating YouTube videos that will be viewed by thousands or millions people around the globe ? Is there a secret recipe ? Is YouTube's algorithm breakable ? Let us try to answer these questions by bringing you through this webiste.

# What is a viral video ?

How shall one define the virality of a video ? This question definitely has many possible answers as many factors come into play. Here are a few of them:

1.  The video has more than a certain number of views (ex. one million)
1.  The video has more views than the channel's past month's average.
1.  The video has a better like/views ratio than other ones.
1.  The video has a better views/subscribers ratio than other ones.

We went with the fourth definition in our work because it would pick videos mostly seen by non-subscribers. This would be explained by the fact that they were either recommended by the YouTube's algorithm or were manually searched for, which we thought was a good description of viral videos.
